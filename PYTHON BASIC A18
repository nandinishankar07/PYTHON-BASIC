!type zoo.py
def hours():
    print("Open 9-5 daily")
1. Create a zoo.py file first. Define the hours() function, which prints the string 'Open 9-5 daily'. Then, use the interactive interpreter to import the zoo module and call its hours() function.
In [2]:
import zoo
zoo.hours()
Open 9-5 daily
2. In the interactive interpreter, import the zoo module as menagerie and call its hours() function.
In [3]:
import zoo as menagerie
menagerie.hours()
Open 9-5 daily
3. Using the interpreter, explicitly import and call the hours() function from zoo.
In [4]:
from zoo import hours
hours()
Open 9-5 daily
4. Import the hours() function as info and call it.
In [5]:
from zoo import hours as info
info()
Open 9-5 daily
5. Create a plain dictionary with the key-value pairs 'a': 1, 'b': 2, and 'c': 3, and print it out.
In [6]:
plain_dict = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}
print(plain_dict)
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
6.Make an OrderedDict called fancy from the same pairs listed in 5 and print it. Did it print in the same order as plain?
In [7]:
from collections import OrderedDict
fancy = OrderedDict(plain_dict)
print(f'plain_dict -> {plain_dict}')
print(f'fancy -> {fancy}')
plain_dict -> {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
fancy -> OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
7. Make a default dictionary called dict_of_lists and pass it the argument list. Make the list dict_of_lists['a'] and append the value 'something for a' to it in one assignment. Print dict_of_lists['a'].
In [8]:
from collections import defaultdict
dict_of_lists = defaultdict(list)
dict_of_lists['a'].append('something for a')
print(dict_of_lists['a'])
['something for a']
